> "As an undergraduate "Data Structures and Algorithms" module was a headache to me. I found it very hard to remember the lectures and I was fed up. But refering online code examples, running them and playinging with them made me fell in love with DSA. So, I decided to create a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms related codes in a single GitHub repo."

This would be very useful for beginners as they'll be able to find whatever DSA related at the same place.

## Practice makes perfect!
* Clone the project to your local space.
	* `$ git clone https://github.com/rukshan99/DataStructures-Algorithms.git`
* Run the codes you want and study whats going on.
* Try to write your own code by making some tweaks.
