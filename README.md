As an undergraduate "Data Structures and Algorithms" module was a headache to me. I found it very hard to remember the lectures and I was fed up. But refering online code examples, running them and playinging with them made me fell in love with DSA. So, I decided to create a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms related codes in a single GitHub repo.

This would be very useful for beginners as they'll be able to find whatever DSA related at the same place.
